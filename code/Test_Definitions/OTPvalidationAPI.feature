# Environment variables:
# * api_root: API root of the server URL
# * phone_number: A public identifier (MSISDN) addressing a telephone subscriptionable to receive SMS. Accordingly to E.164 standard, must be prefixed with '+'.
#     *For additional test scenarios, operator could provide phone number for line that cannot receive SMS, line that blocked SMS reception, not belonging to the operator, designing a landline number.
# * message: Message template used to compose the content of the SMS sent to the phone number. It must include the following label indicating where to include the short code {{code}}. Operator could specified a max_lenght for the message.
# * authentication_id: identifier of a a send-code request. Identifier retrieved in send-code response.
# * max_sent: Maximum allowed request to send code for a given device
# * max_try: Maximum allowed try to validate the code for a given autorisation request.
